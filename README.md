# Terraform-assignment

You need to write a Dockerfile that builds an executable image. 
When the image is run without parameters it should print - “Hello World!” and 
when a <parameter> is passed it should print - “Hello <parameter>. e.g. if the parameter is “Foo Bar”. It should print “Hello Foo Bar”
-> Please sent the Dockerfile and/or any script or executable
 

 

You need to draw a flow chart to communicate the algorithm for the below:
A datastore needs to register a folder(location) before it starts backup. Once registered it does an incremental backup everyday. Every month this folder needs to be emptied to start fresh again however a backup needs to be available always so that the application can be restored; even when the backup folder(location) is emptied. Suggest an efficient way to do this.
NOTE: An incremental backup keeps adding new data but doesn’t delete anything.
HINT: You can use multiple folders but there is a cost associated with the folder/s and storage so use minimum folders and storage.
-> Please sent the flow chart.
 

      

You need to write a Terraform template that creates:
VPC, subnet/s, with one EC2 instance that has an EBS volume attached
Run the `terraform init and plan` command. Copy and the paste the stdout from the terminal in a text file and attach it.

-> Please sent the Terraform template, the output of the `terraform init` and `terraform plan` and screenshots of the resources if any.
